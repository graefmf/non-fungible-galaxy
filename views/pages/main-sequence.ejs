			<h2>About</h2>
			<br>      
			<h4>
			A star is a large cluster of gas that has collapsed under its own gravity. The force of a star's gravity is so strong, that hydrogen atoms 
			are forced together to create helium atoms. This process is called nuclear fusion. When these atoms combine, they release lots of energy and create
			a lot of heat. The super hot core where the fusion takes place creates an immense outward pressure. In a <a class = "mainSequence"  href="/main-sequence">Main Sequence Star</a>,
			this outward pressure counteracts the inward force from gravity and puts the star in a state of equilibrium.
			<br> 
			<br>	
			Stars are classified based upon their luminosity and color. Their color is directly related to their temperature. Astronomers use something called a
			Hertzsprung-Russell diagram in order to see relationships between different stars. On these diagrams, color is usually shown on the x axis, while luminosity is
			on the y axis.
			<br>
			<br>
			<a class = "mainSequence"  href="/main-sequence">Main Sequence Stars</a> are stars that are part of the main sequence band on a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.
			Most stars in the universe are currently part of the main sequence. As stars age, they move away from the main sequence and become things like,
			<a class = "redGiant"  href="/red-giants">Red Giants</a>, <a class = "whiteDwarf"  href="/white-dwarfs">White Dwarfs</a>, <a class = "blackHole"  href="/black-holes">Black Holes</a>,
			and more!
